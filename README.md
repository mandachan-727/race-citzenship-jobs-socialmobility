# Exploring Race, Citizenship, and Academic Pathways for Social Mobility: Perspectives of Undergraduate STEM Majors in a U.S. Liberal Arts College

The United States, renowned for its expansive higher education system, has increasingly prioritized tertiary Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education as a pathway to upward social mobility, a concept defined as “the movement of individuals between different positions in the social structure over time” (Boliver & Wakeling, 2023).. This emphasis aligns with international trends and various government initiatives aimed at positioning the nation as a leader in science and innovation. However, the disproportionate growth of STEM fields compared to non-STEM disciplines has exacerbated existing disparities in access and opportunities, particularly among marginalized racial, ethnic, and gender groups (Medina et al., 2021; Davis & Wilson-Kennedy, 2023). Moreover, the inclusion of international students in the discourse on STEM education adds further complexity, as they face unique challenges due to their citizenship status. The prevailing narrative of STEM as a vehicle for social mobility may also be misleading, as real-world data suggests that a STEM degree does not guarantee upward mobility (Barroso-Luque, 2021). 
In light of these complexities, this study seeks to address two key research questions: first, how race and citizenship inform STEM undergraduates’ preference for STEM over non-STEM disciplines; second, whether STEM undergraduates from underrepresented groups prefer taking STEM classes over non-STEM classes for the expectation of upward social mobility. By exploring how race and citizenship play into undergraduate STEM majors’ perceptions of STEM versus non-STEM disciplines, we aim to shed light on the goals, career expectations, and self-efficacy of STEM undergraduates from underrepresented groups. Simultaneously, it is key in this study that the perspectives of students, whose racial and citizenship identities intertwine, are also amplified. In a national climate where systematic racial discrimination persistently determines educational journeys and social mobility attainment (Davis & Wilson-Kennedy, 2023), while a large body of policymakers and citizens remain hostile to immigrant workers (Porche et al., 2016), this research aspires to provide insights to policymakers and institution administrators in shaping institution-wide and nationwide policies, programs, and practices aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and social mobility within higher education among both STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Moreover, the author envisions that the research findings will be a valuable resource for incoming college students, faculty, and counselors. By gaining a deeper understanding of each student’s unique position within the American educational system, students can collaborate with faculty members to chart a career path that aligns with their definition of success, whether the student chooses to pursue STEM or another field.
